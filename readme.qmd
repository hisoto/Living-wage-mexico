# Subnational Living Wage Estimation in Mexico

## Introduction 

The purpose of this repository is to present the methodology and code for the subnational living wage estimation in Mexico. This project was directed by me, in my position as the Labor Economics Analysis Coordinator, and in collaboration with my partners at the Economic Analysis Directorate of the National Minimum Wage Commission (CONASAMI) in Mexico. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and transparent approach to estimating living wages across different regions of Mexico, taking into account national and international standards for quality of life. It's purpose is the serve as a reference in minimum wage, salary and contractual negotiations. This work is currently under review by different institutions in Mexico, like the National Institute of Statistics and Geography ([INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/)), but a preliminary version of the final results can be found in the [September monthly report](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/1024349/Informe_Septiembre_2025.pdf) of CONASAMI.

It is based on the Anker Methodology, which is a widely used approach for calculating living wages. Particularly, on the [subnational estimation](https://www.ankerresearchinstitute.org/anker-program-subnational#brazil) made in Brazil, but in consideration of the differences of the Mexican context, the main data sources, and the institutional constraints we faced, it has been modified to include the framework developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) for the estimation of the cost of [poverty lines](https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/44920-income-poverty-measurement-updated-methodology-and-results). The code is written in R and Stata, it is organized into several scripts and one Do-file that correspond to different components of the living wage; food, housing and non-food-non-housing (NFNH) costs. The repository also includes a script for the final estimation of the living wage, which combines the results from the previous scripts.

## Data sources

The main data source in the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure ([ENIGH](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enigh/nc/2024/)) of 2024, which is conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in Mexico. 

ENIGH is a nationally, state, urban and rural representative probabilistic survey that collects detailed information on household income, expenditure, and socio-demographic characteristics. It provides the necessary data to estimate the cost of living and the components of the living wage, such as food, housing, and non-food-non-housing costs. 

## Repository Structure 

The repository is organized into the following folders and files: 

- `data/`: This folder contains the raw data used for the analysis, including microdata from national surveys and other relevant datasets. **NOTE:** Due the size of the ENIGH microdata, it is not included in the repository, but it can be accessed through the INEGI [website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enigh/nc/2024/#microdatos).
- `scripts/`: This folder contains the R and Stata scripts for the different components of the living wage estimation, as well as the final estimation script.
- `finaldata/`: This folder contains the output of the analysis, including tables that summarize the results of the living wage estimation.
- `graphs/`: This folder contains figures. 
- `README.qmd`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and the structure of the repository.

## Methodology 

The methodology for estimating the living wage in Mexico is based on the Anker Methodology, which consists of several steps:

1. **Defining the living wage**: The living wage is defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs, including food, housing, and other essential expenses.

2. **Estimating the cost of food**: The cost of food is estimated using the ENIGH to identify the cost of a representative food basket for a reference quintile of the income distribution, which is determined by modifying the methodology used by ECLAC for the estimation of poverty lines. The reference household is defined as a household with two adults and two children that comply with living adequacy criteria, a common family structure in Mexico and that is aligned with the objectives set in the National Development Plan of the federal government. The cost of the food basket is calculated using the prices of food items reported in the ENIGH data at the national, state, urban and rural levels plus a 20% extra considering the cost of waste(5%) and of food diversity (15%).

3. **Estimating the cost of housing**: The cost of housing is estimated using the ENIGH data with a quantile regression approach to estimate the cost of a decent housing for the reference household. It is based on the characteristics of the dwelling, such as the number of rooms and type of construction, following the criteria set by ONU-Habitat for housing adequacy. For the selection of the quantile a similar approach to the one used for the food basket is used, but in this case, the methodology is modified considering the criteria set by ONU-Habitat. The cost of housing is estimated at the national, state, urban and rural levels.

4. **Estimating the cost of non-food-non-housing (NFNH) expenses**: The cost of NFNH expenses is estimated using the results of the housing cost. Using ENIGH we plot the relationship between the housing expenditure and the total expenditure probability distribution and we select the percentile that corresponds to the one selected for the housing cost estimation. This approach is based on the assumption that the NFNH expenses are correlated with housing expenses, which is a common assumption in living wage estimation methodologies. The cost of NFNH expenses is estimated at the national, state, urban and rural levels.

5. **Calculating the living wage**: The living wage is calculated by summing the costs of food, housing, and NFNH expenses for the reference household plus a 5% in terms of savings. 

The end result are 66 living wage estimates, 64 for each combination of state and urban/rural areas, and two for the national level, one for urban and one for rural areas.

The preliminary results of the living wage estimation can be found in the [September monthly report](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/1024349/Informe_Septiembre_2025.pdf) of CONASAMI. The final results will be published in a forthcoming report, which will include a detailed analysis of the living wage estimates and their implications for policy and labor market dynamics in Mexico. 

The following map shows the preliminary results of the living wage estimation for the 32 states of Mexico, disaggregated by urban and rural areas. The living wage estimates are expressed in Mexican pesos per month in August 2024 prices. At the national level the living wage is estimated at `r living_wage |> filter(ambito == "Rural", nom_ent == "Nacional") |> pull(salario_digno) |> scales::number(accuracy = 0.01, big.mark = ",")` pesos per month for rural areas and `r living_wage |> filter(ambito == "Urbano" & nom_ent == "Nacional") |> pull(salario_digno) |> scales::number(accuracy = 0.01, big.mark = ",")` pesos per month for urban areas.
